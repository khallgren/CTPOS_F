How to change text of object at runtime:
CType(objStoreSummary.ReportDefinition.ReportObjects("txtCaption"), CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.TextObject).Text = strCaption

When prompt for login:
1.  Try forcing logon info (see subSetLogon in frmCCSalesPreview)

2.  Make sure source table name matches original query name from report devolopment.  For example:  If rptTest was developed based on qrptTest then
Me.daTest.Fill(Me.dsTest, "qrptSomeOtherName") may not work.  Do this instead: Me.daTest.Fill(Me.dsTest, "qrptTest").
